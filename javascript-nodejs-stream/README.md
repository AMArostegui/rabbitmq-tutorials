# Node.js code for RabbitMQ stream tutorials

Here you can find JavaScript (Node) code examples from [RabbitMQ tutorials](https://www.rabbitmq.com/getstarted.html) related to the [Stream plugin](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/stream).

To successfully use the examples you will need a running RabbitMQ server with the [stream plugin enabled](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/stream#enabling-plugin).

You can easily set this up by [starting RabbitMQ with Streams Enabled](https://www.rabbitmq.com/blog/2021/07/19/rabbitmq-streams-first-application).

## Requirements

Apart from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), these examples use the [`rabbitmq-stream-js-client`](https://github.com/coders51/rabbitmq-stream-js-client) client library.

## Code

Code examples are executed via `npm`:

    npm run publish
    npm run receive
